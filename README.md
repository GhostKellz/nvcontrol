## The Missing NVIDIA Control Panel for Linux + Wayland

**nvcontrol** is a modern, fully featured NVIDIA settings manager for Linux.  
Think: _NVIDIA Control Panel & GeForce Experience, but for Linux + Wayland_.  
No more missing options. No more hacky workarounds. No more nvidia-settings being years behind.

- **Wayland native:** Full support for Wayland compositors (KDE, GNOME, Hyprland, Sway, etc.)
- **Legacy X11 compatible:** Works wherever NVIDIA is available.

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries
Download prebuilt binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/ghostkellz/nvcontrol/releases) page.

### From Source
```sh
# Full installation with GUI and system tray
cargo install nvcontrol --all-features

# CLI only (no GUI dependencies)
cargo install nvcontrol --no-default-features

# GUI without system tray
cargo install nvcontrol --features gui
```

### Build Options
- `--all-features` - Full GUI with system tray support (default for releases)
- `--features gui` - GUI without system tray
- `--no-default-features` - CLI only, minimal dependencies

### Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with nvidia open drivers (570+) at least during testing
- Wayland compositor (KDE, GNOME, Hyprland, Sway, etc.)
- Rust (for building from source)

### Optional Dependencies
- **GUI features**: GTK3, GLib (automatically handled by package managers)
- **System tray**: Desktop environment with system tray support
- **Digital vibrance**: [nVibrant](https://github.com/Tremeschin/nVibrant) for Wayland
- **AUR**: TBD

---

## Usage

### CLI

```sh
nvctl --help
```

### GUI

Launch via your application launcher or run:

```sh
# Full GUI (requires --features gui or --all-features during build)
nvcontrol
```

If built without GUI features, nvcontrol will display an error message.
