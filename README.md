## The Missing NVIDIA Control Panel for Linux + Wayland

**nvcontrol** is a modern, fully featured NVIDIA settings manager for Linux.  
Think: _NVIDIA Control Panel & GeForce Experience, but for Linux + Wayland_.  
No more missing options. No more hacky workarounds. No more nvidia-settings being years behind.

- **Wayland native:** Full support for Wayland compositors (KDE, GNOME, Hyprland, Sway, etc.)
- **Legacy X11 compatible:** Works wherever NVIDIA is available.
